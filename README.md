This project will clean data and provide visualizations on FIFA 21 player data in Python. 

Some of the cleaning that will be done in this project:

- Separating MM/DD/YY (date) into Year, Month, Day columns
- Splitting column data
- Appending the new data
- Converting Height & Weight from inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms
- Removing unnecessary "\n" and other signs such as '★' from columns
- Transforming data types, from strings to integers, i.e. €67.5M into numeric value

Some of the insights and visualisations done in this project:

- Which players have spent more than 10 years at their current club?
- From which countries do most players come from?
- Comparing Player Count and Overall ratings on Country level
- Which countries have the most TOP 100 ranked players?
- Which players are high value but underpaid?
- Are there any outliers in Value vs Wage data?
- Wages per players Position & Age
- Is there any correlation between the age of players and their market value?
- Wages per clubs Overall rating
